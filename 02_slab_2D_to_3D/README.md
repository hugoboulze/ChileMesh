# Module 2: Slab 2D to 3D

Creation of a subduction interface. First the 2D slice of the interface is drawn. Then, it is extended along the path of the subduction trench.

This mesh of the subducting plate has a constant dip angle. It will be projected on the real Chilean slab in **Module 3**.

Run the following script in the current directory:

```
./02_slab_2D_to_3D.sh
```

## File details
---


- `create_nodes_to_move.py`: Define the nodes of the mesh that are allowed (or not) to move during the deformation of the slab (**Module 3**)

- `extension.inp`:  Create the 3D mesh: Extension of the 2D mesh along the path of the Chilean subction trench

- Ì€`refine_meshgems.inp`: Convert the 3D spherical mesh in a 3D flat frame. Remesh the mesh geometries using meshgems.

- `subduction_2D_chile.mast`: 2D geometry of the subduction zone. Open using Zmaster.

- `check_thickness.py`: Compute the thickness of the slab (SLAB) and of the subduction channel (CH)

- `trench_to_geof.py`: Create the .geof of the Chilean subduction trench from the trench_chile_34pts

- `trench_chile_34pts.dat`: List of points picked all along the Chilean subduction trench (in XYZ coordinates) (e.g. using Paraview)
